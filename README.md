There are several chatbots based on the industry or domain in which it is used.

About the project:

I have built a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deeplearning frameworks like tensorflow. This is a restaurant chatbot which answers questions related to a typical restaurant like working hours, items available and several others. We can make it even more comparable to real life situations by including more questions and responses to the dataset.
